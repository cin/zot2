#summary Defines the coding standard to which Zot2 adheres.

= C/C++ Coding Standards =

  * indention and tabbing/whitespace
  * brace placement conventions for controls structures
  * naming conventions
    * file naming conventions
    * class/struct naming conventions
    * camel humps vs underscores and when to use each style. sometimes it's unavoidable as ruby uses these conventions to determine things about the function, variable, etc in question.
    * use of hungarian notation? usage of m_, s_, g_ for member, static, and global variables? full hungarian notation usage, where even ints, floats, and other base types are indicated (i.e. m_iTest, m_fDot, m_szString)? it really does seem archaic but it does improve readability considerably, esp if statics or globals are used. doesn't really fit in with ruby or other scripting languages though...pretty much any language that doesn't care about the object's type.

= Ruby Coding Standards =

  * need a good way to reference C++ standards.
