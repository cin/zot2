#summary Zot2 source compilation guide

  * download cegui (sdk and deps for vc9), sdl, and ode
    * may also want to grab cegui's layout editor
  * add CEGUI, ODE_PATH, BOOST_PATH, OPENAL_PATH, and SDL_PATH env vars
    * [http://zot2.googlecode.com/files/zot2_env_vars.ps1 here's] a link to a Powershell script that may help with setting the environment variables. Be sure to update the locations to where tools are installed on the development machine in question.
    * add dev tools to path, as so:
    * ;%CEGUI%\bin;%ODE_PATH%\bin;%SDL_PATH%\bin
  * if vs is open, close it
    * allows for env vars to be set for next session
  * build ode
    * .\premake4.exe vs2008 from ode build folder
    * build releasedoubledll config

    * build release mode
    * create bin and lib dirs under sdl folder if not already there
    * copy sdl.dll, sdl.lib, and sdl_main.lib to bin/lib
